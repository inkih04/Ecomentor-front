As CO₂ levels rise, they trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. This results in rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Reducing CO₂ emissions is essential to slowing climate change and protecting the planet's future.",
