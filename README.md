# EcoMentor Frontend

**Mobile application to promote energy efficiency in Catalonia**

EcoMentor Frontend is a mobile application developed with React Native and Expo that connects to the [EcoMentor Backend](https://github.com/inkih04/EcoMentor-backend) to provide an intuitive and comprehensive experience in building energy efficiency management.

## Development Methodology

This project was developed following the **Scrum methodology**, enabling iterative and incremental development with regular value deliveries. For source code management, **GitFlow** was implemented, ensuring a structured workflow with specific branches for development, features, and releases.

> **Note**: When transferring the repository to this personal profile, the complete commit history and branches that documented the original development process have been lost.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize real-time energy information of buildings
- **Energy Certificates**: Query and compare energy efficiency certificates
- **AI Assistant**: Intelligent chatbot for personalized sustainability advice
- **Improvement Calculator**: Quantifies the benefits of implementing energy improvements
- **Native Experience**: Interface optimized for iOS and Android

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript** for enhanced code robustness
- **Axios** for API communication
- **React Navigation** for screen navigation
- **Expo Router** for file-based routing
